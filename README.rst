A template for a LaTeX presentation

About
=====

This is a template for a scientific LaTeX presentation created by
Alexander Eberspächer. It uses the beamer class and defines a
beautiful style.

Usage
=====

A ``Makefile`` is provided. Type

::

  make

and ``talk.pdf`` will be created.

Notes
=====

The template uses many different packages - most of which are only
used for convenience of the original author, Alexander Eberspächer. In
your talks, you may need less mathematical packages. However, note
that all packages are included in a full TeXlive installation.
